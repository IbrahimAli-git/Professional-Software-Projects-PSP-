## Project Descripton

For the software projects module we have been tasked with designing and building an application for our clients. Our clients, MTa immersion, are a professional organisation that serves people who are interested in experiential education. Their target audience includes "faculty, staff, administrators, and students in higher education, as well as K-12 (year 1 - year 13) educators, youth development professionals, corporate trainers, and outdoor educators." 

In terms of software this has been detailed in the clientâ€™s specification. It can be split into front-end and back-end development. For the front-end, the user interface, the project specification states that MaterialUI is to be used. MaterialUI is a React framework which allows a developer to build user interfaces. To allow the web app to accept multiple connections, we have used Socket.io which allows multiple users to connect from seperate computers. A mix of MongoDB, Nest.js and TypeScript will be used to create a connection between the database and the application.
